Having achieved his goal, he established the new capital on the site of his original fort. The city expanded rapidly under his descendants.

In times of danger, sluice gates can be opened to flood a channel cut to the west of the castle, turning Riverrun into an island. Its walls rise sheer from the waters and its towers command the opposite shores, making assaulting it almost impossible without huge casualties.</div>
